      Like most app operators, TechBy collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
      such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TechBy's purpose in collecting
      non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TechBy's visitors use its app. From time to time, TechBy may release
      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its app.

      TechBy also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users of the TechBy API.
      TechBy only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
      discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

    z 'h5', 'Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information'
    z 'p',
      '''
      Certain visitors to TechBy's apps choose to interact with TechBy in ways that require TechBy to gather personally-identifying information.
      The amount and type of information that TechBy gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a
      TechBy account to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with
      TechBy – by purchasing games or items in games, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as
      necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, TechBy collects such information only insofar
      as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with TechBy. TechBy does not disclose personally-identifying
      information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent
      them from engaging in certain app-related activities.

      However, TechBy does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. '''
    z 'h5', 'Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information'
    z 'p',
      '''TechBy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated
      organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TechBy's behalf or to provide services available at TechBy's apps,
      and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your
      home country; by using TechBy's apps, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TechBy will not rent or sell potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
      as described above, TechBy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,
      court order or other governmental request, or when TechBy believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
      or rights of TechBy, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an TechBy app and have supplied your email address,
      TechBy may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with
      TechBy and our products. We primarily use blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email
      to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
      to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. TechBy takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
      unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

      user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
      any acquirer of TechBy may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
